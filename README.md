# CPP
C++ showcase game

If you are here, you are either lost, or somehow have been lured here by myself. Either way, welcome!! Please take a look at my ongoing project for furthering my own abilities and education in C++ particularly. 

This project is a project at building a top down tactical RPG. I am pushing myself by working heavily and primarily in the tensorflow lib, I have taken a liking to cluster algorithims and their use in unsupervised learning for enemy generation. While supervised learning seems particularly suited for the battle prediction and difficulty scaling. Need to read further into these areas for upcoming updates. 

Current build status: V1.3 : Taking a small break after Christmas then doing some research and hopefully work on updating the battle prediction by testing a feedforward neural network. Primary goal for now though, is the bug tracker. 


Version 1: Butcher build

Version 1.2: Overhaul from initial butcher build

Version 1.2.1: Rework of Character class

Version 1.2.2: Rework of first portion of Enemy class

Version 1.3: Rework of main()


12/30/22 - Started main function of bug tracker
12/29/22 - Added initial portion of bug tracker
